## Boilerplate Code Shortcut Key

- In most code editors (like VS Code), typing `!` and pressing the **Tab** key inside an empty HTML file expands a basic **HTML boilerplate** instantly.
- This shortcut helps quickly set up the fundamental HTML structure.


## Definitions

### HTML

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages and web applications. It defines the page layout, headings, text, links, images, and more.

### CSS

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation (formatting, colors, spacing) of a web page written in HTML. It separates the content from design for better structure and flexibility.

### Tailwind CSS

**Tailwind CSS** is a popular utility-first CSS framework. It offers low-level utility classes that let developers build custom designs directly in their markup without writing custom CSS for each style, speeding up UI development.

## HTML and CSS Example Code

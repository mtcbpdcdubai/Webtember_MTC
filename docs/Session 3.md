# **1. Intro to JavaScript**
It's a programming language used for both front-end and back-end development. For Webtember, we'll be using it for front-end only.

- **Variables**: Explain how to declare variables and the importance of block scope with `let` and `const`. Emphasize using `const` by default to prevent accidental reassignment, a concept that aligns well with React's principles of immutability.
- **Data-types**: string, number, boolean, `null`, and `undefined`, arrays.
- **Operators**: Include arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison (`===`, `!==`), and logical (`&&`, `||`) operators. The strict equality (`===`) is particularly important to stress.
- **Control Flow**: Teach `if/else` statements and loops (`for`, `while`). These are essential for any programming logic.
